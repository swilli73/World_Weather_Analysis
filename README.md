# World_Weather_Analysis

## Brief description of this analysis

This analysis was performed to simulate a user beta testing the PlanMyTrip app to filter data for maximum/minimum temperatures (in Celsius) for vacation destinations around the world. This narrows down potential vacation spots and further enhances the search by displaying hotel names and coordinates for the preferred temperature limits. With this information, the beta tester can select 4 cities in close proximity from one country/area (the example in this challenge being south/southwestern Mexico) and then see a Geoapify Routing API generated round trip map route for those 4 destinations. 

The one weakness in this simulation is that one of the cities I chose to map, Cabo San Lucas, is inconveniently far/blocked off from the other cities I chose. However, with some simple tweaking of the code, it still works well with some other randomly chosen cluster of 4 cities to output a different result in a different area/country with different temperature preferences.
